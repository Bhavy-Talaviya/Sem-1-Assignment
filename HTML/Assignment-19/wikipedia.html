            <h2>Mutual fund statistics</h2>
            <p>The first introduction of a <a href="/wiki/Mutual_fund" title="Mutual fund">mutual fund</a> in <a
                    href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> occurred in 1963, when the <a

                    href="/wiki/Unit_Trust_of_India" title="Unit Trust of India">Unit Trust of India</a> (UTI). Mutual

            <ul>
                <li>The total <abbr title="Assets Under Management">AUM</abbr> of the Indian mutual fund industry as of
                    December 31, 2023, stood at a staggering ₹50.78 trillion (US$600 billion). This is a significant
                    milestone, marking over a six-fold increase compared to the ₹8.26 trillion (US$98 billion) recorded
                    in December 2013.<sup>[2]</sup></li>
                <li>According to <a href="/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Board_of_India"
                        title="Securities and Exchange Board of India">SEBI</a>, during FY 2022-23, 73 % of mutual fund
                    units were redeemed within 2 years of investment. Only investments in 3 % of the units continued for
                    more than 5 years.<sup>[3][4]</sup></li>
                <li>According to the <a href="/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India" title="Reserve Bank of India">Reserve Bank of
                        India</a> report, mutual funds attracted 6 % of household savings in FY2023 and less than 1 %
                    went into direct equities. Almost 95 % of household savings in India park their money in bank
                    deposits, including fixed deposit, provident fund, <abbr title="Public Provident Fund">PPF</abbr>,
                    life insurance, and various small savings schemes.<sup>[5][6][7]</sup></li>
                <li>According to the S&P SPIVA Report FY2022, over a 10-year period, approximate 68 % of the large-cap
                    actively managed funds failed to beat their respective benchmarks, and over 50 % failed to beat
                    their benchmarks in the mid- and small-cap segments. Within the <abbr
                        title="Equity Linked Savings Scheme">ELSS</abbr> funds category, over 60 % failed to beat their
                    respective benchmarks over 10-year period. Globally, over long periods of time, passively managed
                    funds consistently outperform actively managed funds.<sup>[8][9][10][11]</sup></li>

                    <p>In April 2020, <a href="/wiki/Franklin_Templeton" title="Franklin Templeton">Franklin
                            Templeton</a> India unexpectedly wound up six credit funds with assets of close to US$4

                        These funds had large exposure to higher-yielding, lower-rated credit securities. The <a

                            title="Securities and Exchange Board of India">Securities and Exchange Board of India</a>
                        (SEBI) conducted a probe into this sudden closure and found “serious lapses and violations”.
                        <sup>[15][16][17][18]</sup></p>
                    <p>As a result, in June 2021, SEBI barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund from launching any new debt
                        schemes for two years. The regulator also ordered the fund house to refund investment and
                        advisory fees, along with interest, of more than 5 billion rupees, and fined the global giant
                        another 50 million rupees.<sup>[15][16][17][18]</sup></p>
                    <p>Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the SEBI's order and planned to appeal against
                        it. The decision to wind up the schemes “was taken with the sole objective of preserving value
                        for unitholders”, a spokesperson said. However, the closure of these funds sparked panic
                        withdrawals from other Franklin Templeton schemes as well as credit funds of other asset
                        managers, leading to a storm on social media and court cases by distraught

                        to troubled companies like Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL). This led to severe

                    <p>The <a href="/wiki/IL&FS" title="IL&FS">IL&amp;FS</a> crisis in 2018 had a significant impact on
                        the mutual fund industry, including those managed by IDBI Mutual Fund. The defaults by IL&amp;FS
                        led to a series of downgrades and defaults on its debt obligations and inter-corporate deposits.
                        This situation caused considerable distress in the financial markets and led to significant
                        markdowns in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the affected mutual fund schemes, resulting in
                        losses to investors...<sup>[21][22][23]</sup></p>

                        crisis, making it difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption demands without selling assets
                        at distressed prices. This event heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to widespread
                        downgrades of IL&amp;FS and other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).</p>
                    <p>Consequently, the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these securities were adversely

                        and mismanagement, particularly in its flagship scheme, US-6412. The crisis was exacerbated by
                        the Ketan Parekh scam, which caused a sharp decline in stock prices, leading to mutual funds,

                    <p>The government intervened to protect investors and restructured UTI. This restructuring led to

                        the UTI Trustee Company Pvt. Ltd.) and the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India
                        (SUUTI), which took over the assets and liabilities of the erstwhile UTI. The government's

                    <p>In 2019, <a href="/wiki/Yes_Bank" title="Yes Bank">Yes Bank</a> faced severe financial stress and
                        was eventually placed under a moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in March 2020. This
                        led to significant challenges for Yes Mutual Fund, particularly its debt schemes that had
                        exposure to Yes Bank,s securities. The crisis necessitated write-downs and affected investor
                        confidence. Around 32 mutual fund schemes had exposure to Yes Bank's downgraded debt papers,
                        with a total exposure amounting to approximately ₹2,848 crore.<sup>[41][42][43]</sup></p>

                    <h4>Kotak Mutual Fund</h4>
                    <p>In 2019, Kotak Mutual Fund did face challenges with its Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) due to
                        exposure to debt securities of companies like the Essel Group. The fund house was unable to
                        redeem investments from these companies, which led to delays and partial rollovers of the FMPs.
                        This situation affected the investors, expected returns.<sup>[44]</sup></p>

                    <p>HDFC Mutual Fund did face a situation in 2018-2019 due to its exposure to companies like the
                        Essel Group and IL&amp;FS. The credit events involving these companies led to significant
                        mark-downs in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of some of HDFC Mutual Fund's debt schemes. This
                        situation resulted in investor concerns and redemption pressures. However, HDFC Mutual Fund
                        later recovered the entire investment made in the non-convertible debentures issued by Essel
                        Group companies.<sup>[45][46]</sup></p>

                    <h4>Sahara Mutual Fund</h4>
                    <p>SEBI conducted an examination to determine whether Sahara Mutual Fund, its Asset Management
                        Company, and its trustees were 'fit and proper' as per regulatory standards. This was in light
                        of a previous SEBI order from 2011 concerning two other Sahara entities, which were directed to
                        refund money collected through Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) to investors. In
                        2015, SEBI ordered the winding up of Sahara Mutual Fund's schemes due to non-compliance with
                        regulatory requirements. The regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges indeed led to operational
                        difficulties and affected investor confidence in the fund house.<sup>[47][48][49][50]</sup></p>
